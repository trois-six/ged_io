//! The GEDCOM specifications as data: a validator and a conformance repair
//! pass over [`tree`](crate::tree) structures, for GEDCOM 5.5.1, 7.0 and
//! 7.1.
//!
//! # Tables
//!
//! Every structure type of each version, its tag, its payload type, its
//! permitted substructures with their cardinalities and every enumeration
//! set are generated at development time by `tools/spec-tables/gen.py`
//! into `src/spec/tables.rs`, which holds facts only:
//!
//! - GEDCOM 7.0 and 7.1 from FamilySearch/GEDCOM `extracted-files/`
//!   (Apache-2.0, attributed in `NOTICE`);
//! - GEDCOM 5.5.1 from the gedcom-go transcription of the specification
//!   (MIT, attributed in `NOTICE`), corrected and completed against the
//!   PDF by `tools/spec-tables/551-errata.tsv`, which cites a page for each
//!   row.
//!
//! The tables take a few kilobytes: types are numbered, tags are indices
//! into one shared list, and no build script or dependency is involved.
//!
//! # Validation
//!
//! [`validate`] checks a tree (parsed, or owned [`Structure`]s) against the
//! tables of a version; [`validate_text`] and [`validate_bytes`] also check
//! what only the text shows. Every deviation is reported, with its line,
//! not just the first:
//!
//! | Rule | [`DeviationKind`] |
//! |---|---|
//! | 7.x is UTF-8; a 5.5.1 file is in the character set `HEAD.CHAR` names | `Encoding` |
//! | Line grammar: a level, single spaces, a tag, no empty payload after a space; 7.x: no blank line, nothing before the level, no LF CR | `LineSyntax` |
//! | Levels start at 0, rise by one at most, have no leading zero (5.5.1: at most two digits) | `Level` |
//! | Identifiers: 7.x `@[A-Z0-9_]+@` but not `@VOID@`; 5.5.1 a letter, digit or `_` first, no control character, at most 22 characters; on records only (not `HEAD` or `TRLR`); unique | `Xref` |
//! | `@` in text: 7.x doubles a leading one, 5.5.1 every one outside an `@#…@` escape | `Escape` |
//! | 5.5.1 lines of at most 255 characters, terminator included | `LineLength` |
//! | `CONT` (5.5.1 also `CONC`) right under the line it continues, before the other substructures, never under a pointer, without substructures; 5.5.1 `CONC` never splits at a space; 7.x has no `CONC` | `Continuation` |
//! | 5.5.1 records under 32K | `RecordSize` |
//! | Tags: 7.x `[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*` or `_[A-Z0-9_]+`, 5.5.1 alphanumerics, upper case unless the tag starts with `_`; a standard tag is one the version defines | `UnknownTag` |
//! | Each standard tag under a superstructure that permits it | `Misplaced` |
//! | At most the permitted number of each substructure | `Cardinality` |
//! | Every required substructure; 7.x: a note translation has a `MIME` or a `LANG` | `MissingRequired` |
//! | Payloads of their type: none, `Y`, integers, names, dates, ages, times, languages, media types (7.x `MIME` of a text: `text/…`), file paths, URIs, coordinates, tag definitions, pointers where pointers belong and only there; 7.x: a structure has a payload or a substructure (records and pseudo-structures aside) | `Payload` |
//! | Enumeration values: 7.x exact or an extension value, 5.5.1 in any case (p. 21); open sets admit any value | `EnumValue` |
//! | Pointers name a record of the type the structure points to | `PointerTarget` |
//! | Pointers name a record of the file (7.x `@VOID@` and 5.5.1 substructure and network pointers aside) | `DanglingPointer` |
//! | `HEAD` first and once, `TRLR` last, once and empty, `GEDC.VERS` naming the version | `Header` |
//! | No banned character in a payload: 7.x C0 controls but tab and line breaks, DEL, C1 controls, U+FFFE and U+FFFF; 5.5.1 no control character at all | `Character` |
//!
//! Extension structures (`_TAG`) are checked for what holds everywhere —
//! tags, identifiers, pointers, characters — and their substructures mean
//! what their definer says. Payload sizes of 5.5.1 (`{Size=1:90}`) are not
//! checked: they describe storage limits of 1999-era systems, and no reader
//! relies on them.
//!
//! # Conformance repair
//!
//! [`conform`] rewrites owned structures so that [`validate`] finds nothing,
//! deterministically, keeping all data: what has no standard place becomes
//! an extension structure (`_TAG`) where it was, with its payload and
//! substructures. Each change is reported as a [`Repair`]. This is the
//! structural half of a conformant writer, which
//! [`GedcomWriter::write_tree`](crate::GedcomWriter::write_tree) and
//! [`write_structures`](crate::GedcomWriter::write_structures) run before
//! the line emitter applies the line-level rules (escapes, line length,
//! `CONC`, terminators). The header is completed as the writer completes
//! every header — `GEDC.VERS`; in 5.5.1 `GEDC.FORM`, `CHAR`, `SOUR` and
//! `SUBM` (with a submitter record named `Unknown` when there is none); in
//! 7.x no `CHAR` and no `GEDC.FORM` — which is not reported as a repair.
//!
//! | # | Situation | 7.x repair | 5.5.1 repair |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | a | Closed-enumeration value not in the set | `OTHER` and a `PHRASE` with the value, where the set has `OTHER` and the structure takes a `PHRASE` it has not; otherwise `_TAG` (a list with such a value too) | `_TAG` |
//! | b | Value in the wrong case | Upper case; a list is written `A, B` | The specification's spelling |
//! | c | Text or nothing where a pointer belongs, a dangling pointer | `@VOID@`, and a `PHRASE` with the text or the pointer, where the structure takes one it has not; nothing becomes `@VOID@`; otherwise `_TAG` with the text | `_TAG` with the text (an empty nullable pointer stays) |
//! | c | A pointer where text belongs | The pointer as text | Same |
//! | c | A pointer to a record of another type | `_TAG` with the pointer | Same |
//! | c | A pointer of an extension to no record | The pointer as text | Same |
//! | d | A date or an age outside the grammar | Empty payload and a `PHRASE` with the text, where the structure takes one it has not; otherwise `_TAG` | A date value becomes the date phrase `(text)`; otherwise `_TAG` |
//! | d | An event (`Y` payload) with other text; text where no payload belongs | `Y` (nothing) and a `NOTE` with the text, where a `NOTE` is permitted; otherwise `_TAG` | Same |
//! | d | Any other payload outside its grammar (names, integers, languages, media types, file paths, URIs, coordinates; 7.x `MIME` of a text not `text/…`) | `_TAG` | Same |
//! | e | A standard tag not permitted here, an unknown tag, a tag outside the grammar, a `CONT`/`CONC` structure | `_TAG` (letters upper-cased, other characters `_`); a standard structure only one type has the tag of, valid as that type, keeps its meaning: `HEAD.SCHMA` declares `TAG _TAG` with the type's URI, unless the file uses `_TAG` already | `_TAG` |
//! | f | More occurrences than permitted | The first ones kept; the others become `_TAG`, declared with their type's URI as in (e) | The first ones kept; the others become `_TAG` |
//! | g | A required substructure missing | Synthesised from the list below; otherwise the superstructure becomes `_TAG`, and so on up | Same |
//! | g | 7.x structure with neither payload nor substructure (§1.2) | `Y` where `Y` is a payload of the type; otherwise left out, as it holds nothing | — |
//! | h | Identifiers outside the grammar, duplicated, `@VOID@`, on a substructure, on `HEAD` or `TRLR`; banned characters | Renamed (`@i 1@` becomes `@I_1@`, made unique with `_2`, `_3`…; pointers follow a renamed invalid identifier, and a duplicate's pointers stay with the first record); left out | Same; 5.5.1 tabs become spaces |
//! | i | `HEAD` missing, misplaced or repeated; `TRLR` missing, misplaced, repeated or not empty | `HEAD` first (another becomes a `_HEAD` record); one empty `TRLR` last (one with content becomes a `_TRLR` record) | Same |
//! | j | A 5.5.1 record over 32K | — | Inline notes moved to `NOTE` records, longest first, until the record fits; a record that moving every note would not bring under the limit stays as it is (the limit is a recommendation, p. 10, and nothing else can move out losslessly) |
//!
//! An extension tag the header documents with a standard URI (7.x §1.5.1)
//! is that standard structure, wherever it is, and is repaired as one; an
//! extension that cannot stay standard is never given such a tag.
//!
//! Synthesised substructures (g), besides the header's: a `FORM` of a `FILE` from the file's extension (7.x a media type,
//! `application/octet-stream` when unknown; 5.5.1 a format of its list, else
//! the `FILE` becomes `_FILE`); 7.x `LANG` of a translation (`und`),
//! `ASSO.ROLE` (`OTHER`) and `SLGC.FAMC` (`@VOID@`); any other required
//! text without required parts of its own, such as `TYPE`, `RELA` or a
//! record's `NAME`: `Unknown`. Dates, ages, coordinates and files are never
//! invented.
